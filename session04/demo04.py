int('42') #this will convert a string to a number. function int takes string 42 and returns as an integer that is converted from string
int('hello') #nothing is returned, only error. it can only convert string in the integer format. 
float(42) #function takes 42 as an argument and returns as float (42.0)
str(42) #converts anything to a string
abs(-100,42) #takes only one argument
#some functions - type of arguments matter, but also number of arguments matter
#function can take multiple arguments - max among multiple arguments = what is inside the parentheses is an argument 
round(8999.999) #rounds argument up or down. 
ord('b') #needs a character (string) as an argument and returns as an integer (position in the unicode)
chr(97) #needs an integer as an argument and returns as a character 97--> 'a'
chr(ord('a')) #return as a
chr(ord('a')+25) #25 places under the unicode of z
